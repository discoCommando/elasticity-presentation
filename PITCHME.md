# Elasticity

Note:
ask what is it? 
describe a person who is elastic

+++?image=assets/elasticity.png&size=auto 90%

Note: 
describie what everything means
give an example with reddit 

--- 

Example of why we need this 

---

Problems

---

Provisioning time 

---

How to monitor 

---

Elastic requirements 

---

How can we make application more elastic

---

By solving the problems mentioned above

---

By having a scalable applications

---

What is scalability?

---

What is the difference between scalability and elasticity

---

Scalability

---

Vertical scalability

---

Adding more ram etc. 

---

There is a limit for that

---

Usually it is short term 

---

Horizontal scalability

---

Adding more nodes 

---

Problems 

---

Technology 

---

Single node vs multiple nodes 

---

Explosions 

---

Bottleneck

---

Db - sharding 

---

Load balancers  

---

Elasticity is also about adapting to the error - resilience 

---

How to prevent errors? 

---

Monitor everything 

---

React quickly 

---

Try to automate everything 

---

It reduces work for engineers

---

Reduces software/machine errors - introduces human errors 

---

Failure is normal - you should design for errors because they happens
